# Graph Machine Learning Videos

## [Twin Cities Deep Learning Study Group - Special Guest Daniele Grattarola](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ApL4WHndl_CFgsdoxmWxeJhlPVIWxtAs/view)
July 1st, 2020

Creator and maintainer of the Spektral graph machine learning framework Daniele Grattarola provides both an introduction to machine learning, and a live-coded demo to get up and running with a graph convolutional neural network for two different datasets, one classifying nodes in a graph, and one for classifying complete graphs.

## [Graph Representation Learning (Stanford university)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrhBZUtgG4E)
Stanford University - Oct 3, 2019

Part of the CS224W Graph Machine Learning Course taught by Jure Leskovec
Time: 1:16:52
[Slides](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2018/handouts/09-node2vec.pdf)
Key Insight: At [3:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrhBZUtgG4E) (on slide 5) he mentions that instead of manually putting in features we can automatically learn the features.
